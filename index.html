  <h2>A Chinese Love Story: Music and it's Affects</h2>
<br>For this project I want to take a look at the sound used in the game A Chinese Ghost Story.</br>
<p class="big">
<br><audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="CGS Audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
  <br>This audio is very beautiful to me. It goes with a scene in the game that allows players to explore the natural grounds.</br>
  <br>I think that the tone of this music suggests and encourages exploration while conquering small quests in the field.</br>
  <br>In the game, you hear this music before you know to serach, and referencing Massumi's article, I think that this creates an opportunity for affect of curiosity to take place before emotion is invested in the scene. (note 1)</br>

  <br>There are several musical themes that I would love to explore throughout this game, and this is a small section of one of the more action-focused scenes!</br>
  <br>During this part of the storyline, emotions are highly invested.</br>
  <br>Here, I'd like to point out a few of Lindley's observations on why we play. (note 2)</br>
  <br>One of the reasons Lindley suggests is that we play for pleasure. Pleasure in satisfication of instinct and triumphing over obstacles.</br>
  <br>At this point in the game, we understand that the main character has had someone close to her killed, and each obstacle that we face brings us closer to closure for that death.</br>
  <br>There are several obstacles and fights through the story, and each triumph motivates us more to keep fighting and washes a sense of need for vindication for the wrongful death.</br>
